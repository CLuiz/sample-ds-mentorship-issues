### Getting Started With Your Mentorship

1. Create a github project board:
   * Instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/creating-a-project-board)
   * Set it up using [this as a model](https://github.com/users/CLuiz/projects/1)
   * Create a new repo and [link it to the project board](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/linking-a-repository-to-a-project-board)
   * [Add me as a collaborator with read/write access](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings/managing-access-to-your-user-accounts-project-boards)
1. Think about your goals for the mentorship. Add three goals to the github board. Refer to [my sample board](https://github.com/users/CLuiz/projects/1) for ideas. We will discuss and update them as we progress.
1. Create cards in the TODO column of your github board for all of the following tasks. As you complete them, make comments as to how and close the issues to send them to the 'done' column
   * [Buy these ML Flashcards](https://machinelearningflashcards.com/)
   * Sign up for a [free leetcode account](https://leetcode.com/)
   * Create/update your resume and add it or a link to the Google doc location to your board. 
     * Use [this resource](https://app.sharpestminds.com/static-page/your-resume) once you have access to the SharpestMinds site
